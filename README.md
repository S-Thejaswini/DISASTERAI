### 🌍INTRODUCTION🌊  

Disasters claim the lives of countless people worldwide, causing not only tragic loss of life but also significant economic and infrastructural damage. However, the impact of such disasters can be mitigated to an extent by predicting them in advance and taking proactive measures.  

This project aims to build an **AI-powered system** capable of predicting disasters, providing responses, and analyzing social media sentiment during emergencies. By leveraging advanced machine learning models, the system focuses on disaster prediction while ensuring timely guidance for affected individuals through a chatbot interface.
